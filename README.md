# Multithreading
Used concepts of multithreading, mutex locks, semaphores and process synchronization to implement two real life systems: 
* Implement mergesort modified with selection sort for smaller arrays(size<5) in general(sequential), concurrent and threaded form and compare them on the basis of time used for sorting by them.  
* A system that simulates production of vaccine by multiple companies with different effectiveness, supplied to multiple zones which was used to vaccinate students arriving at random times. 
* A system that simulates an event management having 3 different kind of performers and multiple stages to perform. Also implemented timed wait.
